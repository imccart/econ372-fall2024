Please put your answers in the space provided for each question. You have until 11:15am to complete the exam. Good luck!\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Question 1\n\nConsider the utility function, $u(w)=w^{\\alpha}$. Assume an individual starts with wealth of \\$60,000, and with probability 0.70, this person will get sick and incur a cost of \\$20,000. Assume further that $\\alpha=0.25$. (12 points total)\n\na. What is the expected utility and expected wealth in this situation? (2 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nb. What is the risk premium? (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nc. What is the maximum amount this person is willing to pay for health insurance? (2 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nd. Assume that the probability of illness decreases from 70% to 60%. Does the risk premium increase or decrease? Briefly (just one sentence) explain your answer. (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\ne. Based on your answer to part (d) above, discuss the potential profitability of so-called \"high risk pools.\" Do you think that insurers can operate in such \"high risk pools\" and still earn sufficient profit? (2 points)\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Question 2\n\nBased on the model of adverse selection covered in class, assume an insurer's cost function is given by $C=110q - 3q^{2}$, where $q$ denotes the number of people enrolled in the plan. Further assume that demand is given by $D=130-5q$. The total size of the population is $N=20$. (15 points total)\n\na. Assume the insurer enters this market at time $t=1$ with a price of $p=50$. What is the insurer's profit (or loss) at this price? (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nb. Find the equilibrium price in this market, assuming that insurers earn \\$0 economic profit. Show your answer on a graph. (3 points)\n\n\\newpage \n\nc. The government introduces a subsidy of \\$8 per enrollee, paid directly to insurers. How many additional customers enter the market in equilibrium? (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nd. What is the average (pre-subsidy) cost of the new customers from part c (**only** the new customers)? Compare this to the average cost of the customers originally in the market and discuss your findings in one sentence. Be sure to discuss your findings in the context of adverse selection. (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\ne. The government is considering imposing a penalty on individuals that do not have health insurance. How much must this penalty be in order to induce **all** individuals to purchase health insurance? Note that the penalty must be the same for everyone. (3 points)\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Question 3\n\nConsider a physician or physician practice that sets quantity of care, $x$, and price, $p$, to maximize profits subject to providing at least enough net benefit to meet a patient's best outside option, denoted $NB^{0}$. The physician therefore maximizes profit, $\\pi = px-cx$, subject to the constraint $B(x)-px\\geq NB^{0}$. Assume that the patient receives benefit from care according to the benefit function, $B(x)=20x-x^{2}$, with net benefit given by $NB=B(x)-px$. Further assume that $NB^{0}=4$ and $c=12$, and that the patient pays the full price of care. (15 points total)\n\na. Find the physician's optimal $x$ and $p$. (4 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nb. Find the patient's optimal level of care, $x$. (4 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nc. Draw a graph reflecting the patient and physician's optimal levels of care, along with the physician's price. (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nd. Calculate the amount of consumer surplus that is transferred into producer surplus due to overtreatment. (4 points)\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Question 4\n\nTwo physicians, Dr. Spaceman and Dr. Feelgood, are considering the adoption of a new prescription drug for their patients. Both physicians have access to the same observational data from a clinical trial in which 100 patients were treated with the new treatment, and 50 out of 100 patients showed improvement. The physicians, however, have different prior beliefs about the treatment's effectiveness. (10 points)\n\n   - Dr. Spaceman loves anything new, so his prior follows a $Beta(\\alpha = 1, \\beta = 1)$ distribution\n   - Dr. Feelgood already has a preferred treatment, so his prior follows a $Beta(\\alpha = 1, \\beta = 20)$ distribution\n\na. Calculate the updated belief of Dr. Spacement regarding the effectiveness of the new treatment. Express this updated belief as the mean of the posterior distribution. (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nb. Calculate the updated belief of Dr. Feelgood regarding the effectiveness of the new treatment. Express this updated belief as the mean of the posterior distribution. (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nc. Compare the updated beliefs of Dr. Spaceman and Dr. Feelgood. Interpret how their different prior beliefs have influenced their updated beliefs despite having access to the same observational data. Discuss the impact of prior strength on the updating process. (4 points)\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Question 5\n\nConsider a payment model in which physicians and hospitals (providers, herein) are paid a set amount of money per patient per year, denoted $R$. All patients are \"assigned\" to a given provider by a centralized authority, such that providers cannot control the number of patients they receive. Denote the number of patients assigned to a given provider by $N$. Denote the amount of care provided to each patient by $x$, and denote the costs of such care by the cost function, $c(x,N)$. This is a function of both the quantity of care per patient, $x$, and the number of patients, $N$, with $c(0,N)=0$ (i.e., if the provider does not provide care, they do not incur any costs). Given the fixed number of patients, the provider's profit function is therefore, $\\pi = R \\times N - c(x,N).$ (8 points total)\n\na. What is the providers's optimal level of $x$? **Hint:** this is a logic problem...no derivatives here. (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nb. Explain in 1-2 sentences why providers are likely to provide low quality care in this setup. (3 points)\n\n\\newpage\n\nc. Describe one way that U.S. health policy attempts to maintain high-quality care in a \"more\" capitated payment model (e.g., bundled payments or ACOs). (2 points)\n",
