Consider a risk-averse individual with probability $p$ of getting sick. Let $W_{s}$ be the person's wealth if they are to become sick, and $W_{h}$ the wealth if they stay healthy, where $W_{h}>W_{s}$. In this setup, the person's expected utility would then be:<br>\n$$E\\left[u(W)\\right] = p u(W_{s}) + (1-p) u(W_{h}).$$<br><br>\n\na. Draw the consumer's utility curve under the assumption of diminishing marginal utility of wealth, with wealth on the x-axis and utility on the y-axis. Indicate the person's utility at $W_{h}$ and $W_{s}$. On this same graph, indicate the person's expected utility for $p=0.5$.\n\nThis is reflected in @fig-utility.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Utility and Expected Utility](hwk1-answers_files/figure-pdf/fig-utility-1.pdf){#fig-utility}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\newpage\n\nb. Explain in no more than two sentences why the person's expected utility differs from their original utility curve.\n\nExpected utility reflects an uncertain situation in which the person may receive $w_{h}$ or $w_{s}$ with some probability, while the utility curve reflects the utility if a person is given some $w$ with certainty. These lines differ because the person is risk averse and is therefore indifferent between some amount of wealth, $w^{*}$, and some higher wealth, $\\bar{w}>w^{*}$, in expectation.\n\n\\newpage\n\nc. Show on a new graph the highest possible amount that the person would be willing to pay in order to avoid the (financial) risk of illness.\n\nThe question asks for the risk premium, denoted by $\\pi$ in @fig-insurance-wtp.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Risk Premium and WTP for Health Insurance](hwk1-answers_files/figure-pdf/fig-insurance-wtp-1.pdf){#fig-insurance-wtp}\n:::\n:::\n\n    \n\\newpage\n\nd. Briefly explain how an increase in the probability of sickness, $p$, would impact the risk premium illustrated in part c.\n\nSince we are starting with $p=0.5$, an increase in the probability of illness will *reduce* the degree of uncertainty relative to $p=0.5$. As such, the risk premium will decrease. Importantly, note that the total willingness to pay would still increase since this also incorporates the expected cost of care.\n\n\\newpage\n\n2. Consider the utility function, $u(w)=w^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. An individual starts with a wealth of \\$40,000. With probability 0.4, this person will get sick and incur a cost of \\$10,000.\n\n\n\n\n\na. What is the risk premium for $\\alpha=0.4$?\n  \nFirst we need to find the expected wealth, $E[w]=p_{h}w_{h} + p_{s}w_{s}=$ 36,000. Similarly, the expected utility is $E[u]=p_{h}u(w_{h}) + p_{s}u(w_{s})=$ 66.301. \n\nNext we need to find the amount of wealth that would provide a utility level equal to our expected utility. We get this by inverting the utility function at our expected utility value, $E[u]^{1/\\alpha}$. In our case, this is 35,793.\n\nFinally, we need to subtract this value from our expected wealth to find the risk premium, $\\pi = E[w] - E[u]^{1/\\alpha}=$ 207.\n\n\\newpage\n\nb. What is the maximum amount this person is willing to pay for health insurance (again at $\\alpha=0.4$)?\n\nThe maximum willingness to pay is the risk premium plus the expected cost of care. We know our expected cost is $E[cost]=p_{s}*(w_{h}-w_{s})=$ 4,000. So the maximum willingness to pay is 4,242.\n\n\n\\newpage\n    \nc. Does this amount increase or decrease with $\\alpha$? (show your work)\n\nThis is a little tricky. You could do this problem through brute force, by re-estimating the risk premium with different levels of $\\alpha$, or you could try to find a more general expression for the risk premium. I'll show the answer using the latter approach.\n\nFirst, recall that the risk premium can be expressed as $\\pi = E[w] - u^{-1}\\left(E[u(w)]\\right)$, where $u^{-1}(x)$ denotes the inverse of the utility function at $x$. Rewriting this with our problem yields $$\\pi = (1-p)*w + p*(w-c) - \\left((1-p)*w^{\\alpha}+p*(w-c)^{\\alpha} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}.$$ This provides a very general functional form for the risk premium. \n\n\nWe can then differentiate with respect to $\\alpha$ to find the effect of an increase in $\\alpha$ on $\\pi$. This yields:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial \\alpha} = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( (1-p)w^{\\alpha} + p(w-c)^{\\alpha} \\right)^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}} \\left(\\alpha (1-p)w^{\\alpha-1} + \\alpha p (w-c)^{\\alpha-1}\\right)<0.$$\nThis is a long expression, but all we need to know is that everything here is negative since $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ (also assuming $c<w$ and $p \\in (0,1)$). So, an increase in $\\alpha$ leads to a decrease in $\\pi$. In the extreme, case $\\alpha=1$ means that utility is linear (i.e., risk-neutral), which we know means that the risk premium is 0, so everything checks out. Since our expected cost is unchanged with $\\alpha$, we know that the total willingness to pay must also be decreasing in $\\alpha$. \n\n\n\\newpage\n\n3. Based on the model of adverse selection covered in class, assume an insurer's cost function is given by $C=100q - 3q^{2}$, where $q$ denotes the number of people enrolled in the plan. Further assume that demand is given by $D=110-5q$. The total size of the population is $N=20$.<br><br>\n\n\n\n\n\na. Assume the insurer enters this market at time $t=1$ with a price of $p=20$. What is the insurer's profit (or loss) at this price?\n  \nSetting the inverse demand curve equal to 30 and solving for $q$ yields $q=$ 18. Plugging this into the average cost function tells us $AC=$ 46, which means the insurer is losing 26 on each person, for a total loss of 468.\n  \n  \n\\newpage\n\nb. If the insurer sets price in the next period ($t=2$) equal to average cost at $t=1$, how many individuals will leave the market?\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting price to average cost in the last period means $p=$ 46. At this price, the new quantity demanded is $q=$ 12.8, which means that 5.2 left the market. Since a fraction of a person can't leave the market, we'll say that between 5 and 6 people leave the market.\n\n\\newpage\n\nc. What is the equilibrium price in this market if insurers earn \\$0 profits?\n \nThe equilibrium price assuming zero profits is the price at which $AC=D$. Setting those equal and solving for $q$ yields $q=$ 5. At this quantity, we know the price must be $p=$ 85.\n\n\n\\newpage    \nd. Draw a graph of the marginal cost, average cost, and demand curves in this market. Indicate on this graph the equilibrium price.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hwk1-answers_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n4.

Are these data suggestive of a \"death spiral?\" Why or why not?\n\nThe early years were certainly suggestive of a death spiral. Ultimately, these markets stabilized due in-part to policies related to the ACA. But the premiums ended up much higher than they started. I interpret these data as \"partial unravelling\" but falling short of an all-out death spiral; however, what really matters here is how you support your answer.\n\n\\newpage\n\n5. In practice, adverse selection is really a problem for which insurance plan people select (rather than the decision to be insured or not, which is how our theoretical structure envisioned things). To look at this in the real world, we're going to use some data from **Medicare**. These data are available on our **Canvas** page...just look for the **Data** section on the main landing page. Take a look at the data in your favorite software, and answer the following questions:\n\na. How has enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans changed over time? Use a graph to support your answer.<br>\n\nFirst, let's create the figures that we'll need. I'm going to show you the code first and then the actual graphs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfinal.data <- readRDS('hwk1_data.Rdata')\nfig.avg.enrollment <- final.data %>%\n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(avg_enroll=mean(enrolled, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(year),y=avg_enroll, group=1)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"People\",\n    title=\"Average Number of MA Enrollees per County\"\n  ) + scale_y_continuous(labels=comma, limits=c(0, 8000), n.breaks=8) + \n  theme_bw()  \n```\n:::\n\n\n@fig-avg-enroll presents the results , where we see that average enrollments per county have steadily increased over the past 10+ years.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average Enrollments over time](hwk1-answers_files/figure-pdf/fig-avg-enroll-1.pdf){#fig-avg-enroll}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\newpage\n    \nb. How have Medicare FFS costs changed over time? Use a graph to support your answer.<br>\n  \nTo answer this, I create the exact same graph as before except I use the \"avg_ffscost\" variable, \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfig.avg.ffs <- final.data %>%\n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(avg_ffs=mean(avg_ffscost, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(year),y=avg_ffs, group=1)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\",\n    y=\"FFS Costs\",\n    title=\"Average FFS Costs per Person, per County\"\n  ) + scale_y_continuous(labels=comma, limits=c(5000, 9000)) + \n  theme_bw()  \n```\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting figure shows an interesting pattern of FFS costs, with some ebbs and flows over the past decade. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average FFS Costs over time](hwk1-answers_files/figure-pdf/fig-avg-costs-1.pdf){#fig-avg-costs}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\newpage\n    \nc. Interpret enrollment patterns and FFS costs in the context of adverse selection. Can adverse selection explain these trends? Why or why not?<br>\n  \nFrom the overall yearly averages, it's hard to see any clear patterns. We see a persistent increase in enrollments over time, alongside some general increases in FFS costs. This is perhaps suggestive of some adverse selection problems, in that the people moving to Medicare Advantage may be healthier and thus leaving less healthy (and more expensive) patients in the traditional Medicare FFS program. That said, we see some drops in FFS costs around 2012/2013 and again in 2016/2017.\n\nTo look at this with some more detail, let's just see how this relationship plays out at the county-level. Below are the results of a simple regression of FFS costs against number of MA enrollees. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nNOTE: 2,463 observations removed because of NA values (LHS: 983, RHS: 2,360).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nNOTE: 2,545 observations removed because of NA values (LHS: 983, RHS: 2,360, Fixed-effects: 1,609).\nNOTE: 2,545 observations removed because of NA values (LHS: 983, RHS: 2,360, Fixed-effects: 1,609).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{lccc}\n\\toprule\n  & (1) & (2) & (3)\\\\\n\\midrule\n(Intercept) & \\num{8275.542} &  & \\\\\n & (\\num{8.357}) &  & \\\\\nMA Enrollment & \\num{0.011} & \\num{0.016} & \\num{-0.010}\\\\\n & (\\num{0.000}) & (\\num{0.004}) & (\\num{0.004})\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese regression results, particularly after we account for yearly trends and differences across counties, do not suggest any strong positive relationship between MA enrollments and FFS costs. That's what we would need if adverse selection were playing a major role (increased enrollments in MA would come from the healthy beneficiaries, leaving relatively sicker people in the traditional Medicare program). We therefore conclude that there doesn't seem to be any major adverse selection problem during this time period, which is consistent with the paper in the next part of the question.\n\n\\newpage\n    \nd. Read the paper [\"Steps to reduce favorable risk selection in medicare advantage largely succeeded, boding well for health insurance exchanges\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3535470/) and list three strategies that were used to minimize the effects of selection in the Medicare Advantage market.<br>\n  \n  The papers lists at least four such strategies:\n  \n  1. Improved risk adjustment methods\n  2. Partial \"lock-in\" enrollment period\n  3. Expanded plan options so that the decision to choose MA wasn't so slanted toward certain preferences\n  4. Expansion of prescription drug coverage via Part D, again so that the decision to choose MA wasn't clearly more appealing to one type of person versus another\n    \n    \n\\newpage\n\ne. Pick one of these strategies and explain how you think it might work in the context of the Health Insurance Exchanges. Support your discussion with at least one source from either a peer-reviewed journal or a reputable news/policy agency.\n  \nI'm not too picky here on \"sources\". An easy answer deals with the lock-in period. This policy already exists in the exchanges, but there have been a few \"special enrollment\" periods that have been shown to attract higher risk patients (just as would be expected if adverse selection plays a role). Therefore, continuing such \"lock-in\" enrollment periods will continue to help dampen the effects of adverse selection relative to a world without any such lock-in period. There is a Health Affairs article, [here](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2019.01155), showing higher costs among those enrolling during special enrollment periods.\n  ",
