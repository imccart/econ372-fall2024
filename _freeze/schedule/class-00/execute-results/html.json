This is something I took from [Invisible Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Learning-legendary-Harvard-statistics-ebook/dp/B08P7TJZSQ). An \"airport\" idea is something that is \"so memorable, so deeply entrenched in your brain and how you view the world, that in five years' time -- when I see you at an airport -- you will be able to explain those ideas to me even if you've forgotten everything else.\" These are bigger than learning outcomes or learning objectives.\n\nThe airport idea for Module 0 is this: \"Privatized health care introduces a web of complex incentives.\" This does **not** say that privatized health care is bad, or that it is better or worse than fully public health care...just that using private prices to allocate resources in health care is complicated.\n\nBelow are our specific objectives, activities, and other resources for this introductory module.\n\n## Objectives\n- Recall the total annual expenditures on health and health care in the U.S.\n- Compare U.S. health expenditures and quality to that of other countries\n- Explain the debate surrounding the role of prices in U.S. health care expenditures\n- Summarize some of the unique economic features of the U.S. health care market\n\n## Activities \n- Review the [syllabus](/syllabus/), [schedule](/schedule/), [content](/content/), and [assignments](/assignment/) pages for this class...just to get a feel for the site and how to navigate all of the information.\n- Discussion of U.S. health care expenditures and quality\n- Overview of class and introductions\n- Complete the [Math Review](/resource/review1) and [Practice Problems](/resource/review2)\n\n\n## Readings and related info\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> These articles are more of a guide for the semester.

What's so interesting about health economics? Hopefully this part of our discussion convinces you how important and interesting health economics is. \n\nUse the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later).
